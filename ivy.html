A student can do 1-2 classes each week and each class is 1 hour long. Our 1 hour sessions cost $25 and we are paid after each class(via paypal, venmo, cash, check, etc.) Students are free to drop out of the cource at anytime. To get started you should contact an instructor(info bellow) and ask to set up a date on which the student can start their course. All cources will be help online via zoom or google hangouts. In these sessions our instructors will teach the given course, assign homework, and answer any questions the student may have. Each course will also contain small quizes that the student may need to study for. These quizes will the instructors with there teaching material and show the students knowledge. Our courses consit of Python, Htmls/Css/javascript, C, and Java. In these courses the student will create different applications like websites, bots, games, and more! These course will help students generate a basic understanding of computer programming and logical thinking.
